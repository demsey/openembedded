+.TH TZCONFIG 8 "12 June 1998" "Debian" "Debian Timezone Configuration"
+.SH NAME
+tzconfig \- set the local timezone
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B tzconfig
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+This manual page explains how you can use the
+.B "tzconfig"
+utility to set the local timezone. This is necessary to let your system know about the
+difference between system time and local time (the time in the real world). It is also
+necessary to make your system behave nicely when your location uses Daylight Savings Time.
+
+A valid system time together with the correct local time zone will give you best performance
+and highest reliablility. It is especially important in a network environment, where even small
+time differences can make a mirror refetch a whole ftp site, or where time stamps on
+external file systems are used.
+
+.B tzconfig
+is called without any parameters from the shell. First it presents the current setting and asks
+for verification to change it.
+
+You may press
+.B Ctrl-C
+to interrupt the script at any time.
+
+After you made your choice,
+.B tzconfig
+will try to change the timezone for you. See the
+.B Internals
+section below for technical details. You must have root privilegies to actually change
+anything. Please use
+.BR tzselect (1)
+as a user space command to just look at the timezones. It will print the local time in any
+timezone recognized by the system.
+.SH "A WORD OF WARNING"
+What timezone is correct for your system? It depends on the geographical location of the machine.
+Getting the correct location is important, but
+the system must also know how your hardware clock is set. Most DOS based PCs set their hardware 
+clock on Local Time, while most UNIX systems set their hardware clock to UTC.
+
+The Debian GNU/Linux system gains its knowledge of this setting
+from the file 
+.IR /etc/default/rcS .
+This file contains either the line 
+.BR UTC=yes , 
+which indicates that the hardware clock is set to UTC, or it contains the line
+.BR UTC=no ,
+which declares the hardware clock is set to Local Time. If these setting are correct, and the hardware
+clock is truely set as indicated, then configuring the proper timezone for the machine
+will cause the proper date and time to be displayed. If these are not set correctly, the the
+reported time will be quite incorrect. See
+.BR hwclock (8)
+for more details on this topic.
+
+.SH Internals
+The work done by
+.B tzconfig
+is actually pretty simple. It just updates the link
+.I /etc/localtime
+to point to the correct timezone installed in
+.IR /usr/share/zoneinfo/ .
+
+There is nothing wrong with doing this manually. However, using
+.B tzconfig
+you don't have to remember the path to the timezones.
